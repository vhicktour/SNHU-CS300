# SNHU-CS300

In the projects for this course, I tackled the challenge of efficiently managing and accessing Computer Science course information, emphasizing the importance of selecting appropriate data structures for optimizing run-time and memory usage. My approach was methodical, starting with an analysis of different data structures' strengths and limitations, which underscored why understanding these constructs is crucial for solving complex problems efficiently.

Encountering roadblocks, such as handling file I/O and implementing sorting algorithms, required researching best practices, applying problem-solving skills, and sometimes revising my approach based on trial and error. This process not only enhanced my debugging skills but also deepened my understanding of how theoretical concepts apply in practical scenarios.

Working on this project broadened my perspective on software design, particularly the importance of readability, maintainability, and adaptability in code. I've learned to value clear naming conventions, modular design, and documentation, which together make future modifications and collaborations more manageable. This project has significantly influenced my programming ethos, pushing me towards writing code that not only solves the problem at hand but does so in a way that is considerate of future developers and the evolving needs of the project.
